### Basic Knowledge for PS
- Sorting Algorithm <br>
It's already implemented by Standard Library. It, however, is essential to study how the functions are structured 
and how they are differ from other algorithms.
    - Selection Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort 
    - etc..

- Ability to get along with STRING <br>
String is a type of data that can contain lots of char types. It's actually array of char. <br>
These days, most of Programming Languages have their own string type. <br>
In C++, there is a strong string class in STL. So we need to know what functions are already implemented and how to use them. <br>
There are a lot of problems that asking us to implement a program that should handle the string and sometimes it's complicated.
